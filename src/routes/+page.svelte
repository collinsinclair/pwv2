		This website is primarily a place for me to put things I create or build so that I can access
		them on the go. In fact, it is <em>itself</em> a project that I actively work on and develop. In
		its current manifestation, it is built with
		<a class="font-bold text-orange-600" href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and
		<a class="text-sky-500 font-bold" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind&nbsp;CSS</a> (two technologies
		that I learned specifically for this site!).
